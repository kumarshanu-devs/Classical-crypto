Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)
-------------------------------
Post-quantum cryptography refers to cryptographic algorithms that are secure against an attack by a quantum computer.
Quantum computers are expected to break traditional algorithms such as RSA, DSA, and ECC in the future.

NIST has been running a multi-round competition to standardize post-quantum cryptographic algorithms.

🧪 Key Algorithms (Finalists):
- KYBER: Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) for secure key exchange
- DILITHIUM: Lattice-based digital signatures
- FALCON: Efficient lattice-based signatures
- SPHINCS+: Hash-based signature scheme

🔧 Libraries & Resources:
- Open Quantum Safe (liboqs): https://openquantumsafe.org/
- PQClean: https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean
- pyoqs (Python bindings for liboqs)

🔐 Goal:
Provide future-proof security as quantum computing matures.
