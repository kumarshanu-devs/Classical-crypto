## üìÅ Repository Structure

### üß± Classical Cryptographic Algorithms

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `caesar_cipher.py` | Implements the classic Caesar Cipher with customizable shift. |
| `vigenere_cipher.py` | Vigen√®re Cipher encryption and decryption using a repeating key. |
| `rsa_example.py` | RSA key generation, encryption, and decryption using `pycryptodome`. |
| `aes_encryption.py` | AES encryption and decryption in CBC mode using `pycryptodome`. |
| `hashing_example.py` | Demonstrates SHA256 and MD5 hashing using Python‚Äôs `hashlib` module. |

Each file is accompanied by a corresponding `.txt` document briefly explaining its logic and use cases.

### üß† Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)

With quantum computing on the rise, traditional algorithms like RSA and ECC are becoming vulnerable. This repo introduces **Post-Quantum Cryptography**, backed by NIST's ongoing standardization.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `post_quantum_notes.txt` | A well-researched overview of PQC, NIST algorithms, and links to resources. |
| `pqc_kyber_demo.py` | A demo of Kyber512 key encapsulation using the `pyoqs` library (Open Quantum Safe). |
| `pqc_kyber_demo.txt` | Explanation of the Kyber demo, how to run it, and install requirements. |

#### To install `pyoqs`:
```bash
pip install pyoqs
````

## üß∞ Requirements

Some scripts depend on third-party libraries:

```bash
pip install pycryptodome pyoqs
```
